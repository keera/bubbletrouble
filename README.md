#Bubble Trouble

The new bubble trouble is awful. The old game mechanics are missing, and the graphics make me want to vomit. This is my attempt in recreating the game that I once loved. 

###To do
* Ball splitting - in progress.
* Spear tip - should be a triangle or something...
* Graphics / Sprites - need to find a graphics person
* Music
* Levels 
* Multiplayer
